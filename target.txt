A cloudy day, with outbreaks of rain and drizzle at times. The rain will become light and more patchy into the afternoon. Murky on the coasts. Feeling humid. Maximum temperature 20 Â°C.
Isolated light showers in the north to start, but elsewhere looking dry with bright or sunny spells. Winds staying light and temperatures rather cool to average. Looking further ahead, a north/ south split across the UK seems most likely. Northern and northwestern areas are expected to see further spells of rain, accompanied by strong winds, with the possibility of these spreading to some other areas at times. Further south however, there should be more in the way of dry weather, though even here, there is still the possibility of some showers, or longer spells of rain. Temperatures are likely to be either around or on the warmer side of average, with the warmest conditions likely in the southeast.
